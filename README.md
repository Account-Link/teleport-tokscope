# Teleport TikTok Nooscope

Tools for collecting and analyzing your TikTok recommendations and watch history. Build a personal "nooscope" to understand content recommendation patterns, track meme propagation, and analyze sentiment shifts over time.

![Demo](nooscope.gif)



## Quick Start

**No TikTok account needed to get started!**

```bash
npm install && npm run build      # Install and build
docker compose up -d              # Start browser container

# Option 1: Web Interface (recommended)
node examples/tokscope-web.js     # Visit http://localhost:8001

# Option 2: Command-line
node tokscope.js sample           # Collect 20 videos from public For You
node tokscope.js status           # Check what you've collected
```

**Output organized by type:**
```
output/nooscope/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public-foryou/           # Public timeline samples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ authenticated-foryou/    # Your personalized feed
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ watch-history/           # What you've watched
```

**Authenticate for personalized data:**

```bash
node tokscope.js auth              # Shows QR code in terminal
node tokscope.js sample --auth     # Sample your personalized feed
node tokscope.js watch-history     # Collect your watch history
```

Scan the QR code with TikTok mobile app. Session saved automatically.

**Commands:**
- `node tokscope.js sample` - Sample public For You feed
- `node tokscope.js sample --auth` - Sample your personalized feed
- `node tokscope.js auth` - Authenticate with QR code
- `node tokscope.js watch-history` - Collect watch history
- `node tokscope.js status` - Show collection status
- `node tokscope.js` - Interactive menu


## How It Works & Troubleshooting

The nooscope uses a containerized browser that you can watch in real-time:

**üîç Watch the Browser:**
- **Web Interface:** Click "Show Viewer" in nooscope-web at http://localhost:8001
- **Direct Access:** Open http://localhost:8080 (username: `neko`, password: `neko`)

This is invaluable for:
- Verifying sampling is working
- Debugging authentication issues
- Understanding TikTok's page structure
- Taking manual control when needed

**Common Issues:**
- **"Connection refused"** - Run `docker compose up -d` to start the browser
- **"Not authenticated"** - Run `node tokscope.js auth` and scan QR code
- **"No videos collected"** - Check the neko viewer to see if TikTok loaded correctly
- **Authentication fails** - Try refreshing the browser in neko view before auth

## For Developers: Workbench & Enclave

**Workbench** (`workbench.js`) - Interactive development environment:
- Build and test new sampling strategies
- Inspect DOM structure and test selectors
- Debug with screenshots and session recording
- See [docs/workbench.md](docs/workbench.md) for detailed guide

**Enclave** (TEE-ready) - Production deployment reference:
- Multi-container isolation with remote attestation
- Secure credential handling for remote nooscope services
- Reproducible builds for auditability
- See [docs/enclave.md](docs/enclave.md) for complete details

## Proxy Support

Both workbench and enclave support SOCKS5 proxies:

```bash
# Workbench with proxy
SOCKS_PROXY=socks5://17.100.0.1:1080 docker compose up -d
SOCKS_PROXY=socks5://17.100.0.1:1080 node workbench.js auth

# Or set in environment
export SOCKS_PROXY=socks5://17.100.0.1:1080
```

See [WORKBENCH.md](WORKBENCH.md) for detailed proxy configuration.

# Enclave (TEE Reference Implementation)

The Xordi Enclave is a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) reference implementation for running nooscope sampling as a trusted remote service. It provides remote attestation that credentials are only used for legitimate purposes.

**Quick start:**
```bash
# Development mode
docker compose -f docker-compose-audit.yml up --build

# Dashboard
node enclave-examples/dashboard.js  # Access at http://localhost:4000
```

**Key features:**
- Multi-container isolation with remote attestation
- Reproducible builds for verification
- Module system for proprietary API authentication
- Static analysis to prove credential safety

See [ENCLAVE.md](ENCLAVE.md) for complete documentation including:
- Reproducible build instructions
- DStack deployment
- Module system details
- API specification
- Testing procedures

## Contributing to Nooscope Tools

**Develop new sampling scripts:**
```bash
node workbench.js navigate foryou
node workbench.js inspect
node workbench.js test "div[data-e2e='video-title']"
```

**Document your findings:**
```bash
node workbench.js screenshot
# Saves: output/screenshots/foryou-YYYY-MM-DD.png
```

See [WORKBENCH.md](WORKBENCH.md) for detailed development workflows.

## Related Work

**Data donations**
The Teleport Noscope is most closely related to prior work on *data donations,* which rely on users using the "data download" feature of social media services and uploading these zip files to a data collector.
Compared to these, the main novelty in this collection method is the use of TEEs to carry this out remotely but in a secure way. 

On TikTok:
- [Analyzing User Engagement with TikTok's Short Format Video Recommendations using Data Donations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3613904.3642433) - Research on algorithmic transparency and content analysis
- [Washington Post TikTok Collection](https://omarshehata.substack.com/p/washington-post-is-collecting-tiktok) - Journalistic effort to understand TikTok's algorithm

We are inspired by the Community Archive project, who we hope will find these tools useful for understanding social media content propagation and sentiment analysis.

We build on [neko](https://neko.m1k1o.net/) for the containerized browser with GStreamer/WebRTC viewing portal, and [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser automation.

## Troubleshooting

**Workbench issues:** See [docs/workbench.md](docs/workbench.md#debugging-tips)
**Enclave issues:** Check `docker compose -f docker-compose-audit.yml logs`
**Build issues:** Ensure TypeScript compiled: `npm run build`
